Time series forecasting project to predict store-level sales with interactive user input for flexible predictions.

# Overview
This project focuses on forecasting sales at the store level using time series models. It includes an interactive user-input interface that allows predictions for specific stores and date ranges. This helps retailers plan inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies based on projected demand.

# Problem Statement
Retail businesses need to anticipate sales at each store to optimize operations and avoid overstock or understock. This project solves that by building per-store sales forecasting models with dynamic input capabilities for on-the-fly predictions.
